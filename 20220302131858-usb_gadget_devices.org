** Serial ACM connection

*** USB as a serial connection from Linux USB host (USB-A) to Embedded Linux USB gadget(USB-C)

Prerequisites
- Make sure you've configured the Embedded Linux to have [[id:29d73f87-f7d2-4523-acf4-06e8558d9861][Support for USB Gadgets]]
- Embedded (USB-C) Host run the following
#+begin_src bash
  modprobe g_serial use_acm=0
#+end_src


- On the Host side attach the USB cable (USB-A)

- Capture the key USB information from the connection
#+begin_src bash
dmesg -w 
#+end_src
- You should see Wait until you see these lines

- Setup the serial

- You can now test your connection using ttyUSB1 ->  /dev/ttyGS0


**** Caveats

 There's an issue where if you don't have the device attached already
 ( USB connected ) then you won't get the drivers to load
 correctly. You will see something like the following

#+begin_example
[  167.773853] udc-core: couldn't find an available UDC - added [g_serial] to list of pending drivers                                                    │·····
